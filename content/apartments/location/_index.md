Greensboro, located in the heart of North Carolina’s Triad region, offers everything
that much larger cities have, while maintaining a small town feel and a low cost of
living. With 50,000 college students attending one of the city's seven colleges and
universities, Greensboro enjoys myriad entertainment choices: college and professional
sports, unique restaurants, craft breweries, arts, and music. Greensboro also boasts
more than 90 miles of trails and greenways.

And Market Station is convenient to everything. Located on West Market Street, the
property is close to I-40 and I-73, providing easy access to  PTI Airport, Friendly
Center, and all of Greensboro’s and the greater Triad area's major employers. The
downtowns of both Greensboro and High Point are within 15 minutes, and Winston Salem
is just five minutes further. There’s also plenty of shopping nearby, and the Greenboro
Transit Bus Line stops right out front.

**Come by Market Station and see everything we have to offer.**
